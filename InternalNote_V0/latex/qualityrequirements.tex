\section{Quality Requirements}
\label{sec:QualityRequirements}

To ensure a spatial resolution better than \SI{100}{\micro\metre}, the fibres have to be accurately positioned. Due to many different influences problems occur during the winding process. The exclusive error is the wrong positioning of a fibre. This will manipulate the continuing fibre mat production, so that other fibres can't fit in their decided position. In the most situations the error is limited to a small region, but a small error can get worse in higher layers.
Plots shown here are the result of a winding simulation. For more Informations see \cite{WindingSimulation}.

One important point is the fluctuating diameter of the scintillating fibre. The trend of the diameter shows thick regions up to \SI{500}{\micro\metre}. These thick regions, called bumps, cause a wrong positioning of the neighbouring fibres. An example of such a error is showed in Fig. \ref{blob}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Another problem are fibres, who skip a notch and create therefore an empty space. These empty spaces will be filled up by fibres belong to a higher layer actually. This will cause there an empty space too (see Fig. \ref{missing}).
\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

On the basis of this influences (and many more) a good positioning of the fibres during the winding process has to be guaranteed to receive a good fibre mat. Unfortenuately a scintllating fibre without bumps can't be delivered by the manufacturer. As a result of this bumps which cause problems have to be cut out. To make a statement about the positioning of the fibres and if a bump has to be cut out, a camera system will be used to monitor the fibres exactly.
