The Scintillating Fibre Tracker is part of the LHCb Upgrade to be installed in the LS2 which starts in 2018 (see LHCb Tracker Upgrade Technical Design Report \cite{LHCb-TDR-015}). The Tracker consists of scintillating fibres with a diametre of \SI{250}{\micro\metre} and a length of \SI{2.4}{\metre}. These fibres are stacked in six layers with a \SI{275}{\micro\metre} horizontal pitch. To detect the scintillation light multichannel silicon photmultipliers (SiPM) with a channel width of \SI{250}{\micro\metre} are used. Their height matches the height of the six layer fibre mat.

A fibre crossing particle generates a signal in more than one corresponding SiPM channel, so that the his position is calculated from the charge barycentre. The fibres are mirrored at the middle of the \SI{5}{\m} high acceptance and read out by the SiPMs at the outer edges. The readout electronics are to be based on a custom designed ASIC which includes pre-amplifier, shaper, ADC, clusterization and zero suppression.

This document describes the production of the fibre mat with a focus on the quality assurance during the production.
